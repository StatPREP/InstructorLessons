Additional tutorials that we might want to repurpose:

#. The globe toss. Write up instructions for the globe toss, including a link to the spreadsheet.
#. [Regression](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/SimpleRegression/#section-explanatory-variables-1). Re-write this using `mosaicModel`.
#. [Hypothesis tests](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Htest/#section-independence-in-two-way-tables) simplify this into two lessons: means and proportions. 
#. [Contingency tables](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Htest/#section-independence-in-two-way-tables) Instructor tutorial to encourage them to use the Fisher test.
#. [Resampling R](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Resampling) Update to `df_stats()` and post as an instructor tutorial.
#. [Explaining the permutation test](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Permutation_test/#section-many-trials) as an instructor tutorial and then the t-test little app.
#. [P value variation](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/p_value_interval/) Blog post.
#. [Densities](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Densities/). Put this in a blog post.
#. [Little r](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Little_r/). Put this in a blog post.
#. [Designing density graphics](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Conditional_densities/#section-guiding-the-eye). A blog post, too?
#. Relative risk. Write a little app about relative risk using bootstrapping and randomization to get inferential statistics.
