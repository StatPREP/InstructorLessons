Instructor notes at `StatPREP.github.io/InstructorNotes`


Additional tutorials that we might want to repurpose:

#. Statistical inference recommendations: Flesh out the stub in Remodeling Statistics on "Teaching Statistical Inference"
#. [Resampling R](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Resampling) Update to `df_stats()` and post as an instructor tutorial.
#. Put more data-frame commands in the tutorial on tidy data.
#. [Explaining the permutation test](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Permutation_test/#section-many-trials) as an instructor tutorial and then the t-test little app.
#. [P value variation](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/p_value_interval/) Blog post.
#. [Densities](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Densities/). Put this in a blog post.
#. [Little r](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Little_r/). Put this in a blog post.
#. [Designing density graphics](https://dtkaplan.shinyapps.io/Conditional_densities/#section-guiding-the-eye). A blog post, too?
#. Relative risk. Write a little app about relative risk using bootstrapping and randomization to get inferential statistics.
