## The Graphics Goal

Goal: Translate the contents of data frames into representative and telling images. 
* Creating such statistical images constitutes a fundamental way
of turning *data* into *information*. 

* Often this amounts to making sure that **important differences** can be
**easily** and **accurately** seen.

* This tutorial introduces 

    * techniques for **designing** and **generating** stat graphics 
    
    * concepts and conventions for **reading** stat graphics
   
Note: Before students can **see to learn**, they need to **learn to see**.

* Providing them with a good framework and vocabulary for communicating about
graphics is one step in this process.

## Three types of graphs

It's helpful in discussing stat graphics to think about three distinct graphical modes, each of which has its own characteristic icons.

1. **Data graphics** --  each row in a tidy data frame is represented by a 
simple mark, also known as a **glyph**.

2. **Statistical graphics** -- visual summary of overall trends across 
many rows of a data frame.

3. **Inferential graphics** -- graphics designed to help the informed reader
judge whether the trends seen in statistical graphics 

    * carry genuine meaning, or 
    
    * are better thought of as the kinds of illusory, accidental patterns we see in
like animal shapes in clouds or archers and crabs in the stars.

    Inferential graphics are important to keep us from placing too much meaning
    in spurious patterns.

Often two or more types of graphs are overlaid into a single plot.


## The graphics frame

A **graphic frame** is the structure for organizing stat graphics.

* Mathematicians like to call this "Cartesian coordinates" or "x-y axes" (but 
other sorts of frames are possible).

### Properties of a graphic frame

* **size**: physical extent on paper or screen
* **x** variable: A variable (from a tidy data frame) assigned to the x-axis.
* **y** variable: Another variable assigned to the y-axis. 

#### Example

The tradition in mathematics is to call the horizontal axis "x" and the vertical
axis "y." But in statistics we deal with so many variables that it's better to
call the axes by the names of the variables they represent. To illustrate,
Figure \@ref(fig:frame1) shows a graphical frame defined by the variables height
and age.

```{r frame1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "A graphics frame for presenting data on height and age, as from the [NHANES data frame](ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/web/packages/NHANES/NHANES.pdf).", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
gf_blank(Height ~ Age, data = NHANES)
```

### Graphics frames with categorical variables {-}

You can also use a graphics frame to represent the values of a 
*categorical* variable. We use evenly spaced positions along an axis
and asign them to levels (possible values) of the variable.

#### Example

```{r frame3, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="A graphics frame defined by one quantitative and one categorical variable.", message = FALSE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
gf_blank(Height ~ Education, data = NHANES %>% select(Height, Education) %>% na.omit()) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Data graphics

Pick

* a variable (your choice) to put along horizontal axis
* a variable (your choice) to put along vertical axis
* (optional) other variables that determine color, shape, size, etc.

### Example: Height by Age

This plot uses a dot (●) for each row of some data coming from the NHANES study.

```{r frame2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="200 rows from the `NHANES` data frame represented as glyphs, one for each row, in the height vs age graphical frame.", warning = FALSE, message=FALSE }
set.seed(101)
gf_blank(Height ~ Age, data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_point(Height ~ Age, data = sample_n(NHANES, size = 200))
```

### Example: Height by Education

```{r frame2b, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="200 rows from the `NHANES` data frame in the height vs education graphical frame. Note how the individual glyphs overlap in some places. This problem, over-plotting, becomes more of a problem when many more rows are being plotted.", warning = FALSE }
set.seed(101)
gf_point(Height ~ Education, 
           data = sample_n(NHANES %>% select(Height, Education) %>% na.omit(), 
                           size = 200)) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```



### Jittering {-}

Rather than placing the glyph exactly at the position for its categorical 
level, it's helpful to move it a small random distance to the right or left
when the exaplantory variable is categorical. This is called **jittering**.

* No loss of information (we can still tell the values of x and y for each variable)
* Reduces overplotting (so may gain information)
* Gives a better representation of the data


```{r frame2c, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="1000 rows from the `NHANES` data frame using jittering to avoid overplotting.", warning = FALSE }
set.seed(101)
gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, height = 0, width = 0.15,
           data = sample_n(NHANES %>% select(Height, Education) %>% na.omit(), size = 1000)) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Transparency

Another simple way to deal with overplotting when working with data frames with
thousands of rows is to make the glyphs somewhat transparent. That way, overlap
of glyphs is signalled by relative darkness.

```{r frame2d, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="10000 rows from the `NHANES` data frame using both jittering and transparency to avoid overplotting.", warning = FALSE }
gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, 
          height = 0, width = 0.15, alpha = 0.15, seed = 101,
          data = NHANES %>% select(Height, Education, AgeDecade) %>% na.omit()) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```

## Two Categorical Variables

### Jittering both categorical variables

Jitter can be used for two categorical variables.

```{r categorical_jitter, fig.cap = "A jitter plot of education vs age decade for the NHANES data. Each row in NHANES is one dot in the plot."}
gf_jitter(Education ~ AgeDecade, data = NHANES, alpha = 0.1)
```

#### Your Turn

1. What trends do you see in the plot above?
2. What might explain those trends?

### Smoothing the jitter

In reading the dots it's mainly the overall darkness of the squares that we
read. We could replace each square with one that's uniformly dark and still get
the same information. Like this:

```{r with_patches, fig.cap="A frame of two categorical variables with the number of cases at each combination of levels shown as opacity. This is a statistical graphic, not a data graphic."}
NHANES %>%
  group_by(Education, AgeDecade) %>%
  tally() %>%
  gf_point(Education ~ AgeDecade, alpha = ~ n, size = 10, shape = 15)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
NHANES %>%
  gf_point(Education ~ AgeDecade, alpha = 0.002, size = 10, shape = 15)
```

#### Your turn

1. Is the plot above a data graphic?
2. Can you find someone who disagrees with you?

<!-- This could be either:   -->
<!-- If we make one box per grouping, it is a statistical graphic.   -->
<!-- If we overlay lots of semi-transparent squares, it's a data graphic. -->

## Statistical graphics

We can make the previous figure two ways:

1. Place a semi-transparent square for each observation (data graphic)

    * 10,000 squares with lots of overplotting

2. Place one square at each of the 45 grid locations and use the 
number of values (a statistic) to determine its color/transparncy (stat graphic).

    * 45 squres using a statstic (count) computed from the original data.

The second option is more efficient and provides us more control.


### Cross tabulation -- Is this a graph?

The particular marks used in Figure \@ref(fig:with_patches) are only modestly
successful at displaying the count. People are not very accurate at perceiving
shades and things become hopeless when the counts differ by a factor of ten or
one-hundred or more. So, for showing counts, another graphical style is
perferred, the *cross tabulation*.

```{r comment = "", echo=FALSE}
tally(Education ~ AgeDecade, data = NHANES)
```

```{r tab1, fig.cap="A cross-tabulation of education versus age decade", fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nil.png")
```

It's not conventional to call a cross-tabulation a "graphic." But it has all
the elements:

* graphics frame: education vs age decade 
* glyph: a number

It is a **statistical graphic** becuase we have one mark for 
each group of values for which we have computed a count.

Perhaps this makes a cross tabluation feel more like a graphic:

```{r, cross-tabl-graph, fig.width = 7}
tally(Education ~ AgeDecade, data = NHANES, format = "data.frame") %>%
  gf_point(Education ~ AgeDecade, alpha = ~ Freq, 
           color = "red", size = 10, shape = 15) %>%
  gf_text(Education ~ AgeDecade, 
          label = ~ Freq, size = 4, angle = 30,
          color = "navy", alpha = 0.8)
```

### Segmented bar charts

Here is another common graphical presentation of counts in the
form of a printed table. 
<!-- There are also non-text graphics for counts, but these -->
<!-- are effective only in cases where the entries are not too far ranging in -->
<!-- magnitude. Figure \@ref(fig:bar1) shows an example -->

```{r bar1, fig.cap = "A non-text, graphical presentation of counts."}
gf_counts( ~ AgeDecade, fill = ~ Education, data = NHANES, alpha = 0.5)
```

These can be hard to read.

* Although labelled "count," the vertical axis is really accomplishing 
two things at once. 

    * The overall height of each bar tells the number of rows 
    from the data frame that fall into each age decade. 
    
    * A second variable, `education`, is being displayed using **fill color**. 
    For each bar, the colors show the number of data table rows at each 
    educational level. Because the same colored segments don't have the same
    starting position, they can be difficult to compar accurately.

### Proportions in bar charts    

Sometimes proportions are displayed rather than counts.

```{r bar2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A graphic showing the proportion of people at each educational level for the various age decades."}
gf_counts( ~ AgeDecade, fill = ~ Education, data = NHANES, alpha = 0.5, 
           position = "fill")
```

### Means and such

For a quantitative variable, two very commonly used statistical summaries are
the **mean** and **median**. There are many other possibilities:

  * min
  * max
  * 75th percentile
  * etc.
  
Here is a figure that shows such a data graphic, 
but with another **layer** added to show a statistical summary with the mean.

```{r mean-graphic, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Combining a data graphic (the jittered points) with a statistical graphic (the horizontal lines). The statistic displayed is the mean height.", fig.align="center", warning=FALSE}
gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, data = NHANES %>% filter(!is.na(Education)),
          size = 1, alpha = 0.06) %>%
  gf_errorbar(
    mean_Height + mean_Height ~ Education, 
    data = df_stats(
      Height ~ Education, 
      data = NHANES %>% filter(!is.na(Education)), mean),
    color = "blue", size = 1) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))
```

### Glyphs for statistical graphics

In the Little Apps, we have chosen to use "horizontal" glyphs for 
statistical graphics (so they are quickly identifiable as statistical layers).
So we use horizontal lines rather than dots.

#### Your turn

1. How is height related to education level?
2. What are some possible explanations for this trend? 
3. Which do explanations do you find plausible? implausible?


## Statistical Functions

When describing the relationship between two quantitative variables, a powerful
summary of the aggregate properties of the data is to describe the relationship
as a **function**. Since the aggregate properties are being described, the
appropriate statistical graphic is a graph of the function.

```{r pulse-bp, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A graphic with two layers -- a data layer and a statistical layer -- showing the relationship between pulse rate and blood pressure in the NHANES data.", fig.align="center"}
gf_jitter(BPSysAve ~ Pulse, data = NHANES, 
          alpha = 0.02, height=0, width=1) %>% 
  gf_lims(x = c(40,120), y= c(75, 175)) %>%
   gf_lm() %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Blood pressure")
```

The particular function shown here suggests that people
with higher pulse rates tend to have lower blood pressure.

## Inferential graphics

Recall that the descriptive statistical layers above 
suggest a **relationship** between
the two variables being displayed: the mean height increases with increasing
education and the average blood pressure decreases with increasing pulse rate.

One of the important contributions of stats as a science is to provide methods
to assess whether such patterns are genuinely informative. These methods produce
what are called **inferential statistics**. And, just as the Little Apps use 
a horizontal style for displaying descriptive statistics
they use a vertical graphical style for displaying inferential statistics.


### Error bars 

```{r height-inferential, fig.cap="Two forms of inferential statistics for the relationship of height versus education: *prediction* intervals and *confidence* intervals."}
mod1 <- lm(Height ~ Education, data = NHANES)
Pred <- mod_eval(mod1, nlevels = 5, interval="prediction")
Conf <- mod_eval(mod1, nlevels = 5, interval="confidence")
P <- gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, data = NHANES %>% filter(!is.na(Education)), alpha = 0.01) %>%
  gf_errorbar(model_output + model_output ~ Education, data = Pred, 
              color = "blue") 
  
P %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper ~ Education, data = Pred, color = "blue", width = 0.3) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "95% prediction intervals") %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 

P %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper ~ Education, data = Conf, color = "blue", width = 0.3) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "95% confidence intervals") %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```

The I-beam shaped marks are widely called **error bars** in many natural and
social science fields. In stats, they are also called **intervals**.

The range covered by the intervals corresponds to some measure of the 
precision of the statistic. 

* **prediction intervals** measure the precision of predictions that can be made about an **individual**. 

    * For example, if asked to predict the height of a high-school graduate, 
    the function derived from the `CPS85` data indicates that the person would 
    be between 149 and 188 cm in height. Looking at the graph you can see 
    that each of the prediction intervals covers a broad range of heights 
    and that the intervals for the different education levels overlap a lot. 
    In everyday speech, this could be described as, 
    "Education level hardly tells you anything about how tall a person is."

* **confidence intervals** measure the precision of the estimated statistic.

    * Rather than making a prediction about an individual person, the prediction
    is being made about the result of a whole new random sample of data about
    height and education. If such a new sample (of the same size as NHANES and
    from the same population) were taken, likely the calculated mean height for
    each group would be somewhat different from what we found in NHANES. How
    different? That's what the confidence interval tells you. In other words,
    confidence intervals are about how precisely the study was done while
    prediction intervals are about what the data have to suggest for predictions
    about an individual for whom you know education level but not height.

Confidence intervals are always narrower than prediction intervals. 

### Error Bands

When the descriptive statistic is a function relating two quantitative
variables, the inferential statistic equivalent of prediction and confidence
intervals are called prediction and confidence **bands**. Such bands are also
drawn with the vertical component.

```{r pulse-bp-inferential, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A graphic with three layers -- a data layer, a statistical layer, and a statistical inference layer. Left: prediction band. Right: confidence band", fig.align="center"}
P <- gf_jitter(BPSysAve ~ Pulse, data = NHANES %>% sample_n(size = 1000), 
          alpha = 0.05, height=0, width=1) %>% 
  gf_lims(x = c(40,120), y= c(75, 175)) %>%
  gf_labs(y = "Blood pressure")
P  %>% gf_lm(interval = "prediction") 
P  %>% gf_lm(interval = "confidence")
```


## A trend in height?

### Height and Education

<!-- Referring to Figure \@ref{frame2d}, introduce the stat showing the trend across -->
<!-- education levels, that people get taller with higher levels of education. Give -->
<!-- the inferential stat and show that the trend is for real. -->

```{r eframe1, echo = FALSE,  warning = FALSE }
ci.mean = mosaicCore::ci.mean
Stats <- df_stats(Height ~ Education, data = NHANES, mean, ci.mean)
gf_jitter(
  Height ~ Education, height = 0, width = 0.15, alpha = 0.08, seed = 101,
  data = NHANES %>% select(Height, Education, AgeDecade) %>% na.omit()) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper  ~ Education, data = Stats, 
              color = "red", width = 0.9) %>% 
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```

### Education or age?

<!-- One possible explanation for the relationship between height and educational -->
<!-- level concerns age. Decades ago, a much smaller proportion of the population -->
<!-- graduated from high-school. Similarly, nutrition was worse, which can inhibit -->
<!-- growth. So perhaps the apparent relationship between height and education is -->
<!-- really about height and the nutritional conditions when growing up. ... Here's a -->
<!-- graph showing inferential statistics by age decade. The people aged 20-29 grew -->
<!-- kup in the last two decades, the people 70+ grew up 50 years before. -->

```{r eframe2, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
set.seed(101)
stats <- df_stats(Height ~ Education + AgeDecade, data = NHANES, mean, ci.mean)
# gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, height = 0, width = 0.15, alpha=0.15,
#            data = NHANES %>% select(Height, Education, AgeDecade) %>% na.omit()) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper  ~ Education | AgeDecade, data = stats, color = "red", width = 0.9) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```

### Age and education?

Looking at the same inferential statistics, we
can redefine the graphics frame so that age is on the x-axis and education is
used for facetting. Doing this draws attention to the relationship of height
versus age *given* a level of education. 

What can you see now?


```{r eframe3, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE }
set.seed(101)
stats <- df_stats(Height ~ Education + AgeDecade, data = NHANES, mean, ci.mean)
# gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, height = 0, width = 0.15, alpha=0.15,
#            data = NHANES %>% select(Height, Education, AgeDecade) %>% na.omit()) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper  ~ AgeDecade | Education, data = stats, color = "red", width = 0.9) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```


### And then there's gender.

Sometimes, the confidence intervals get smaller if we add still more variables
to the display. For instance, we know that women's heights tend to be smaller
than men's.

```{r eframe5, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Inferential graphics on their own. The far separation between the confidence intervals is often misleadingly described using a technical terms with a meaning different from that of everyday speech: very highly statistically significant.", warning = FALSE }
stats <- df_stats(Height ~ Gender, data = NHANES, mean, ci.mean)
# gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, height = 0, width = 0.15, alpha=0.15,
#            data = NHANES %>% select(Height, Education, AgeDecade) %>% na.omit()) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper  ~ Gender, data = stats, color = ~ Gender, width = 0.9) 
```

<!-- The viewer of such a graph might understandably be misled into thinking that -->
<!-- women are much shorter than men. After all, the confidence intervals are widely -->
<!-- separated. Such a pattern is called "statistically significant" and a spread as -->
<!-- big as that seen in Figure \@ref(fig:eframe5) would be labelled "very highly -->
<!-- statistically significant." (Significance is generally quantified with a number -->
<!-- called a "p-value." By convention, a p-value of 0.05 or less is called -->
<!-- "statistically significant," and a value of 0.001 or less is called "highly -->
<!-- statistically significant." The p-value corresponding to Figure -->
<!-- \@ref(fig:eframe5) is p < 0.000000000000001.) The use of the word "significant" -->
<!-- in this context is traditional, but has been strongly criticized for decades. -->
<!-- The reason: statistically significant absolutely does not mean "important in -->
<!-- practice." Here are two plots that add context to show that the differences -->
<!-- between women's and men's heights are not as large as might be suggested by -->
<!-- "very highly statistically significant." -->

To put the inferential statistics in the context of the practical meaning of
height differences between men and women, either or both of two techniques can
be used. First, the height axis can be arranged to show the differences on a
scale of the typical height, as in Figure \ref(fig:eframe5b). This is
accomplished by rooting the vertical axis at zero height, just as our feet are
rooted on the floor. You can also show the inferential statistics in the context
of the person-to-person variation of height, as in Figure \ref{fig:eframe5c}.

```{r eframe5b, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Inferential graphics with an axis scale that allows the difference between the sexes to be set in context of the height itself. ", warning = FALSE }
stats <- df_stats(Height ~ Gender, data = NHANES, mean, ci.mean)
# gf_jitter(Height ~ Education, height = 0, width = 0.15, alpha=0.15,
#            data = NHANES %>% select(Height, Education, AgeDecade) %>% na.omit()) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper  ~ Gender, data = stats, color = ~ Gender, width = 0.9) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) %>%
    gf_lims(y = c(0, NA))
```

```{r eframe5c, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Putting the inferential statistics in the context of the person-to-person variability in height.", warning = FALSE }
stats <- df_stats(Height ~ Gender, data = NHANES, mean, ci.mean)
gf_jitter(Height ~ Gender, height = 0, width = 0.15, alpha=0.025, data = NHANES) %>%
  gf_errorbar(lower + upper  ~ Gender, data = stats, color = ~ Gender, width = 0.9) %>%
    gf_lims(y = c(0, NA))
```

There is a clear trend in the differences between
females and males, and that there is a lot of overlap in the heights of
individual females and males. One way to think of this is as a guessing game.
Suppose you were given the heights of two people, one male and one female.
You're asked to guess, knowing just their height, which of those two people is
female. Playing the odds, you'll probably guess that the taller one is male.
This will be right much of the time, but it will also be wrong a lot of the
time.

Now change the game. You're being given the heights of two groups of 5000 people
each. One group is females, the other males. Your job is to guess which group is
which. A simple and highly effective strategy is to calculate the mean height of
each group and declare the group with the shorter mean height to be female. This
will be right 100% of the time.

Statistical "significance" is about group differences. Practical significance is
about individual differences.


### Putting it all together

What do you see now, when sex differences between the sexes are taken into account?

```{r eframe6, echo = FALSE,  warning = FALSE }
stats <- df_stats(Height ~ Education + AgeDecade + Gender, data = NHANES, mean, ci.mean)
gf_errorbar(lower + upper  ~ AgeDecade | Education, data = stats, 
            color = ~ Gender, width = 0.9) %>%
  gf_theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```
