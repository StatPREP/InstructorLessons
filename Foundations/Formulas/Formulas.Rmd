## The modeler's tilde

R provides a concise notation for describing the role that one or more variables are to play in a calculation. This notation, called a *formula*, is used so much in statistical computation that it is worth introducing even before the computations themselves.

Formulas always involve the tilde character.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tilde-medium.png")
```

As a typewritten character, `~`, it's quite small and easy to miss. And in a small font, the ![](images/tilde-small.png) isn't much different from the minus sign (`-`). But tilde means something completely different from minus.

The position of ![](images/tilde-small.png) on the keyboard varies from brand to brand. On Apple keyboards, it's here.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/keyboard-tilde.png")
```

### Exercise

Find the ![](images/tilde-small.png) on your keyboard and type `~ x` in the code block.
```{r type-tilde, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2, exercise.cap = "Your first formula!"}

```

```{r type-tilde-check, echo = FALSE}
# This is an unusual use for for_checkr(), including the tests there. 
# This is because the formula is not an argument, which for some reason messes up
# evaluation in line_where().
# USER_CODE <- quote(foo <-  ~ y)
for_checkr(USER_CODE, 
           insist(is_formula(V), "Not a formula"),
           insist(all.vars(f_rhs(V)) == "x", "The formula was supposed to have 'x' on the right-hand side, not {{f_rhs(V)}}."),
           passif(TRUE, "Good!")
)
```

The output is the same as the input, because you haven't yet asked R to do anything with the formula. (You can ignore the `environment` line in the output.)


## Tilde constructs formulas


The word "formula" is used to describe an R expression with tilde. Usually the formula involves one or more names of variables. These are all legal formulas:

* `~ x`
* `y ~ x`
* `x ~ y`
* `y ~ x + z`
* `magic ~ abracadabra + smoke + mirrors`


Every formula has something to the *right* of the tilde. This could be a variable name, a number, a period, and so on.

```{r type-tilde2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2, exercise.cap = "Scratch work space"}
```

Use the scratch work space above to try out the following expressions, one at a time, to see if they are legal in R. You'll know an expression isn't legal if R responds with an "unexpected end of input" or some other error statement. If there's no error, the formula will be printed. (Don't worry about the `environment` line. That's a bit of R jargon that we don't need.) 

```{r formula-form-quiz}
quiz(
  question("Is `~ .` legal?",
    answer("yes", correct = TRUE),
    answer("no")
  ),
  question("Is `~ 1` legal?",
    answer("yes", correct = TRUE),
    answer("no")
  ),
  question("Is `fish ~` legal?",
    answer("yes"),
    answer("no", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("Is `~ +` legal?",
    answer("yes"),
    answer("no", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```



## Formulas as arguments


Many of the commands you construct will follow this template. You just have to fill in the blanks.

<center>
<h3><strong> <span class="boxed">function</span> ( <span class="boxed">formula</span> , data = <span class="boxed">data_table</span> , ... )</strong> 
</h3></center>



Each of the blanks plays a specific role. 


* **`function`** will be replaced with the name of the operation you want to perform. There are a couple dozen  such operations that you will encounter frequently. Here, consider these two:    
    1. `df_stats` which calculates basic statistics.
    2. `gf_point` which constructs scatter plots. 
* **`formula`** is a formula, usually containing variables in the data table.
* **`data_table`** will be the name of a data table on which you want to perform the operation. `Galton` is such a name.
* **`...`**. Many functions take additional arguments specifying details of the operation. What these details are depends on the operation, and not all functions require additional arguments. For instance, the `df_stats()` function you will use next takes an additional argument specifying what statistic (e.g. the mean) to calculate.

## One- and two-sided formulas

Keep in mind the basic structure of a command:

<center>
<h3><strong> <span class="boxed">function</span> ( <span class="boxed">formula</span> , data = <span class="boxed">data_table</span> , ... )</strong> 
</h3></center>

Almost always, the formula used when applying a function will contain the names of variables in the `__data__` table. To illustrate, consider the `Galton` data table, which looks like this.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# options(tibble.print_min = 4)
# print(as_tibble(Galton))
SDSdata::SDS_table(Galton, show_n = 4)
```


If there is just one variable involved in the operation, the name of that variable goes in the right-hand slot and the left one is unused. For instance:

```{r qstat1, exercise = TRUE}
df_stats( ~ height, data = Galton,  mean)
```

When there are two variables involved, typically one goes on the left of ![](images/tilde-small.png) and the other on the right, for instance:
```{r qstat2, exercise = TRUE}
df_stats(height ~ sex, data = Galton, mean)
```

### Exercise

In the following code block, replace the blank `__formula__` to create a scatterplot of child's `height` versus that of the childs `mother`.

```{r template1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2, exercise.cap = "Using formulas"}
gf_point(__formula__, data = Galton)
```

```{r template1-check, echo = FALSE}
# USER_CODE <- "gf_point(height ~ mother, data = Galton)"
code <- for_checkr(USER_CODE)
L1 <- line_where(code, insist(F == "gf_point", "Use gf_point() as the function. The formula is the argument."))
formula_arg(L1, 
            insist(all(all.vars(V) %in% names(Galton)), "You referred to variable names that aren't in the Galton data, specifically {{all.vars(V)[! all.vars(V) %in% names(Galton)]}}."),
            insist(all.vars(f_lhs(V)) == "height", "Sorry. The vertical axis corresponds to the variable on the left-hand side of the formula. You used '{{all.vars(f_lhs(V))}}`, which is not what was asked."),
            insist(all.vars(f_rhs(V)) == "mother", "The `mother` variable should be on the horizontal axis. You used '{{all.vars(f_rhs(V))}}`."))
```

<div id ='template1-hint'>
Remember that "height vs mother" means that the height variable goes on the y axis and the mother variable on the x-axis.
</div> 


### Exercise

Replace `__formula__` with the appropriate formula to draw a histogram of the `height` variable in `Galton`.

```{r hist1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2, exercise.cap = "Using formulas", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
gf_histogram(__formula__, data = Galton)
```

```{r, hist1-code-check}
formula_exists <- function(user_code) {
  message = ""
  if ( ! grepl("~", user_code)) message = "Remember to provide a formula as an argument."
  message
}
USER_CODE %>% check_blanks()
USER_CODE %>% formula_exists() 
```

```{r hist1-check, echo = FALSE}
ta <- find_call("~ whatever", message = "the first argument should be a formula.")
t1 <- find_call(" whatever ~ whatever")
t2 <- find_call("~ height", message = "you should have `height` on the right-hand side of the formula.")
USER_CODE %>% ta %>% t1 %>% was_mistake("the formula should be one sided.")
USER_CODE %>% t2 
```
